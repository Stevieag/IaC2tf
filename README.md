# IaC2tf
The beginning of an idea to provide a Iac to Tf Script


This script can at this time only take in a Cf script of a type to rewrite to Tf.
It is a POC exploring the complexity involved to use Bash to do this.

The wish is to create seperate scripts for each type of infra on each cloud provider to transfer the providers IaC to Tf.

A pyQt5 GUI is added to allow a simpler avenue for access. All GUI actions utilise the bash script.
